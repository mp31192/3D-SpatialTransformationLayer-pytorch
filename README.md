# 3D SpatialTransformationLayer pytorch
Implements a 3D spatial transformer layer in pytorch. More detail will be add in future.

The link of spatial transformer layer [1] paper is https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025.
This code is modified according to the code of Hsankesara (https://github.com/Hsankesara/VoxelMorph-PyTorch/blob/master/voxelmorph3d.py#L259) and Ryo-Ito (https://github.com/Ryo-Ito/spatial_transformer_network/blob/master/grid.py). 

My sincere thanks to them contribution.
